Random Password Generator Challenge

Overview

This project is a random password generator designed to fulfill the requirements of a coding challenge. The generator allows users to specify the length of the password and select which character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters) to include in the generated password. The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript programming, user input validation, and basic HTML/CSS layout.

Features

	•	User Input: Users can specify the length of the password within the range of 8 to 128 characters.
	•	Character Selection: Users can choose whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in the password.
	•	Validation: The program validates user input to ensure the selected length is within the specified range and at least one character type is selected.
	•	Random Generation: The password is randomly generated based on the user’s input criteria.
	•	Display: The generated password is displayed to the user on the web page.

Usage

	1.	Open the index.html file in a web browser.
	2.	Click on the “Generate Password” button.
	3.	Follow the prompts to specify the length of the password and select character types.
	4.	Once all prompts are answered, the generated password will be displayed on the page.

Technologies Used

	•	HTML: Provides the structure of the web page.
	•	CSS: Styles the appearance of the web page elements.
	•	JavaScript: Implements the logic for generating random passwords and handling user input.
